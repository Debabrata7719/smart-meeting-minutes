# 🎙️ Smart Meeting Minutes

An intelligent offline tool that transforms meeting recordings into structured summaries and actionable highlights. No API keys required - everything runs locally on your machine.

## ✨ Features

- **Offline Transcription**: Uses Vosk for speech-to-text conversion (no internet required)
- **AI-Powered Summarization**: Generates concise meeting summaries using Hugging Face Transformers
- **Smart Highlights Extraction**: Automatically identifies and categorizes important topics, decisions, and action items
- **Multi-language Support**: Transcribe English or Hindi audio
- **Context-Aware Extraction**: Captures full context around important statements, not just keywords
- **Efficient Processing**: Streaming transcription with real-time progress tracking

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- ffmpeg (for audio processing)
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
# Install Python packages (includes Streamlit)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For summarization (optional but recommended)
pip install transformers torch

# Install ffmpeg
# Windows: winget install ffmpeg
# macOS: brew install ffmpeg
# Linux: sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

**Note:** Streamlit is included in `requirements.txt` for the web interface.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Web Interface (Recommended)

Launch the Streamlit web interface for an easy-to-use GUI:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open your browser automatically. You can:
- Upload audio/video files via drag-and-drop
- Select language and options
- View results in the browser
- Download summary and highlights files

### Command Line Interface

Alternatively, use the command-line interface:

```bash
# Process a meeting audio/video file
python -m src.transcripter.cli "path/to/meeting.mp4"
```

This will generate:
- `meeting_summary.txt` - Concise summary of the meeting
- `meeting_highlights.txt` - Structured highlights with categorized important topics

### Advanced CLI Usage

```bash
# Hindi transcription with English translation
python -m src.transcripter.cli meeting.mp3 --language hi --translate

# Skip summarization (only generate highlights)
python -m src.transcripter.cli meeting.mp3 --skip-summary

# Custom output directory
python -m src.transcripter.cli meeting.mp3 --outdir my_outputs

# Disable progress updates
python -m src.transcripter.cli meeting.mp3 --no-progress
```

## 📂 Output Files

### `{filename}_summary.txt`
A concise, AI-generated summary of the entire meeting. Perfect for quick overviews.

### `{filename}_highlights.txt`
Well-structured highlights organized by categories:

- **Key Decisions & Actions**: Important decisions, agreements, and action items
- **Financial Metrics**: Revenue, profit, costs, budgets, pricing
- **Growth & Business**: Market expansion, sales, deals, contracts
- **Customer & Users**: Customer metrics, retention, churn
- **Planning & Forecasting**: Forecasts and future planning
- **Operations & Team**: Hiring, headcount, team updates

Each highlight includes full context, making it easy to understand what was discussed.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Audio Processing**: Converts input audio/video to mono 16kHz WAV format using ffmpeg
2. **Transcription**: Uses Vosk offline speech recognition model to convert speech to text
3. **Analysis**: Extracts important topics using intelligent pattern matching and context detection
4. **Summarization**: Generates concise summary using Hugging Face Transformers models
5. **Structuring**: Organizes highlights into categorized, readable format

## 🌍 Language Support

- **English** (default): Full support for transcription and summarization
- **Hindi**: Transcription support with optional English translation

### Language Examples

```bash
# English (default)
python -m src.transcripter.cli meeting.mp3

# Hindi transcription
python -m src.transcripter.cli meeting.mp3 --language hi

# Hindi with English translation
python -m src.transcripter.cli meeting.mp3 --language hi --translate
```

## 📝 Command Line Options

```
positional arguments:
  input                 Path to input audio file (.mp3/.wav/.mp4/etc)

optional arguments:

  --reuse-transcript    Use existing transcript file instead of audio
  --important-only      Extract only sentences with important keywords
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Team Meetings**: Quickly capture decisions and action items
- **Client Calls**: Generate summaries for follow-up
- **Conference Calls**: Extract key points from long discussions
- **Interviews**: Summarize important responses and topics
- **Training Sessions**: Create structured notes from recordings

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Core Technologies

- **ffmpeg**: Audio/video preprocessing and format conversion
- **Vosk**: Offline speech-to-text recognition
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Text summarization and translation
- **Python 3.8+**: Core runtime

### Model Downloads

Vosk models are automatically downloaded on first use:
- English: `vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15` (~40MB)
- Hindi: `vosk-model-hi-0.22` (~1.5GB)

Models are cached in the `models/` directory for future use.

🎙️ Meeting Transcription & Summarization

This project is designed to transform raw meeting recordings into clear, structured notes without using any paid APIs.

🔎 What It Does

Full Meeting Transcription

Takes an audio/video file as input (e.g., .mp3, .wav).

Converts it into the right format (mono, 16kHz WAV).

Transcribes the entire meeting speech to text using the offline Vosk model.

Meeting Summarization

Once transcription is complete, the text is passed to an open-source summarizer.

Produces a clean, concise summary of the whole meeting.

Scanning for Key Points

The transcript is further scanned to extract highlights and important-only notes.

This ensures the final output is not just text-heavy but also action-oriented.

📂 Outputs Generated

For a meeting file (say meeting.mp3), the system produces:

meeting_transcript.txt → Full transcript of the meeting.

meeting_summary.txt → Short, human-readable summary.

meeting_highlights.txt → Key highlights (optional).

meeting_important.txt → Only the most important points (optional with --important-only).

🚀 Why This Project?

Meetings are often long and repetitive.

This tool saves time by:
✅ Converting speech to text
✅ Summarizing automatically
✅ Highlighting only what matters most

🛠️ Core Technologies

ffmpeg → Audio preprocessing

Vosk → Offline transcription

Hugging Face Transformers → Text summarization
